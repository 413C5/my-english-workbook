# My English Workbook

My English Workbook is an English language learning application for Android devices. It is simple and reliable, so it can be used to learn both vocabulary and verbs through a series of lessons and exercises to measure progress. The sections in the app are:

- Vocabulary
- Regular and Irregular verbs
- Reading comprehension

In order to navigate through the app, several elements have been incorporated. These include a hamburger menu for selecting different sections (such as vocabulary, verbs, or reading), a tab bar for toggling between content (study materials) and exercises, and a list view for displaying the content. Exercises encompass a diverse range of formats, including selecting the correct option from a list of radio buttons, completing inputs, choosing options from a picker (list box), and matching sentences.
